Digital Echo 🪞

A tiny, creative CLI app that remembers only the last thing you said.

No history. No accounts. No noise. Just a quiet echo from your past self.

✨ Idea

Most apps try to remember everything. Digital Echo does the opposite.

Each time you run it:

You see one sentence from last time

You write one new sentence

The old one disappears forever


It’s minimal, personal, and a little bit philosophical.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

python echo.py

That’s it.

📝 Example

Last time you said:
"I was tired but hopeful"

Say something (max 60 chars):
> Today feels lighter

Next run:

Last time you said:
"Today feels lighter"
